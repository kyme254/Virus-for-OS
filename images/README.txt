Seems like you got hit by DemonWare ransomware!

Don't Panic, you get have your files back!

DemonWare uses a basic encryption script to lock your files.
This type of ransomware is known as CRYPTO.
You'll need a decryption key in order to unlock your files.

Your files will be deleted when the timer runs out, so you better hurry.
You have 10 hours to find your key

C'mon, be glad I don't ask for payment like other ransomware.
